950826 bugfix in GenerateDecTab(): LEA.W instructions were generated.
950312 New file disk.cc, for (guess what) disk support. Doesn't work yet.
950311 Multiplication instructions were generating 16 bit results.
       Sign extension was wrong in some places.
       Removed bugs in the blitter (one word width: ALWM & AFWM and line mode)
       The Kickstart logo looks perfect now.
       Playfield routine should check BPLCON0 instead of BLTCON0
950309 ASR D8,D0 is not a valid instruction.
       Bitplane pointers were not incremented.
       Copper comparison didn't work. COP2LC and bitplane pointers were written
       incorrectly. Fixed.
       Something that bears a striking resemblance to the familiar Kickstart
       logo now appears in my X window!
950306 ROR used to set the X flag. Bug fixes in GenerateDecTab.
       More bug fixes in several 68000 instructions.
       Improved blitter. ?????? KS1.3 doesn't seem to set BLTDMOD on a 
       line draw. What is this??
       Fixed stupid bugs in playfield code.
950305 fixed bugs in opcode generation and interrupt handling. Implemented 
       STOP. Fixed flag settings: Result wasn't masked. Ooops!!
       ADDQ #imm,An doesn't set flags.
       One-shot timer mode didn't work.
       Implemented blitter, doesn't work.
       Some primitive and slow playfield support, only to make the things that
       hopefully will soon appear visible.
950304 CIA timers ought to work OK. Copper is emulated.
       Emulator loops infinitely when trying to initialize the console.device
950303 experiments with X, figured out how to open a window and draw pixels.
       No graphics emulation yet, though.
950301 Nearly all instructions work.
       Fixed supervisor mode stack.
       The memory manager now handles CIA chips.
950228 Bug fixes in 68000 code, exceptions and more instructions implemented
       Memory management extended to handle custom chips as well.
       Debugger improved.
       Kickstart passes memory & CPU type test, builds up some system
       structures.
950227 MC68000 & little debugger for tracing. It can execute the first couple
       of KS1.3 instructions, but doesn't get past the memory test.
950225 Work begun
